It is estimated that every year, more than 291,000 people die from seasonal flu-related illnesses [#fludeaths]_. While there are diseases that cause more deaths, we know how to virtually completely prevent them. For example, tuberclosis claimed 1.6 million deaths in 2017 [#tbdeaths]_, but only around 500 of those deaths were in the United States [#ustbdeaths]_. Diseases like tuberclosis, cholera, or measles have been effectively 'solved' in developed countries. All that we need to do is to 'port' these solutions to the developing world. It may cost money, it may take time, but we know what works.

Influenza is different. Approximately 80,000 people died in the United States in 2017 alone [#usfludeaths]_, and as recently as 2009, the World Health Organisation declared an influenza pandemic [#2009pandemic]_. Especially with  influenza's extremely fast rate of mutation, it is unlikely that we will be able to find a fundamental solution to influenza any time in the near future, making it vital that we find ways to contain the spread of influenza.

As can be seen from the constant budget crises facing the British National Health Services, our society seems to have priorities other than human life [#nhsbudget]_. It is therefore of paramount importance that we allocate the limited resources available to most effectively contain influenza and minimise its impact. We will be focussing on the developed world to ensure that the hypotheses we explore and the policies we propose go beyond the state-of-the-art.

We first start by cleaning the data we have and adding other datasets we believe may be informative in INSERT SECTION LINK HERE. We then perform some EDA on this collected data to check its validity in INSERT SECTION LINK HERE. Models are created based on this refined data in INSERT SECTION LINK HERE, and the conclusions are presented in INSERT SECTION LINK HERE.
